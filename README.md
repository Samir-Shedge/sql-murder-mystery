# SQL Murder Mystery – Who Killed the CEO?

This is a SQL investigation project where I solved a fictional murder case using database queries.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The CEO of TechNova Inc. was found dead in the CEO Office at 9:00 PM on 15 Oct 2025.  
I analyzed keycard logs, phone calls, alibis, and physical evidence to identify the killer.

## 🗂 Database Tables
- employees
- keycard_logs
- calls
- alibis
- evidence

## 🔍 Investigation Steps
1. Confirmed crime location using evidence table
2. Tracked who entered the CEO office
3. Cross-checked alibis using JOIN
4. Analyzed suspicious phone calls
5. Matched physical evidence with movements
6. Identified the killer using multi-table joins

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL (JOINs, Subqueries, Time Filters)

## ✅ Final Result
The killer was identified using logical SQL investigation techniques.

📌 This project helped me understand how SQL is used in real-world investigations.
